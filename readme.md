# Interactive Web 2.0 Application Components
Following along with Brad Dayley's final chapter from the MEAN web development book. Built using the rough architecture provided in the book. The front end will be built without using the ejs engine used in the book, and will be built using a more modularized controller structure.

## Project Description
- Tabbed views: Easily integrate tabbed views that are hidden and yet still gives the user the ability to access the views quickly and in an obvious way.

- Weather gadget hooks into a backend remote weather service to get weather information .

- Draggable view is a basic page with images and text elements that can be dragged and re-positioned in the view.

- Tables view implements a front end for the words database from several chapters back. There are controls to sort, filter, and page through the results without reloading the page.
